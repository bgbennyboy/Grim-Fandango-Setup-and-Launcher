# Grim-Fandango-Setup-and-Launcher
There are two parts to this project; an installer and a launcher program. 

Grim Fandango Setup:
A replacement installer (setup program) for Grim Fandango. The installer that comes with the game can be problematic with newer versions of Windows and refuses to work at all on 64 bit Windows.
It performs a full install of the game and comes with my Grim Fandango Launcher – which adds extra features beyond those in the game’s original launcher.

Grim Fandango Launcher:
An improved version of the launcher program that LucasArts shipped with Grim Fandango, it has a number of features not present in the original launcher:

* Can run Grim Fandango from hard drive (play without the cds) and can automatically copy the required files to the hard drive.
* Can run Grim Fandango in windowed mode.
* Automatically enables Grim Fandango’s developer/debug mode. (The good_times registry key).
* Provides a synopsis of debug features and debug keys.
* Can download and install the update patch if its not applied.
*  Works on both 32 bit and 64 bit versions of Windows and has been tested on XP through to Windows 11.
